## Code
The code is contained in the src folder. It is based on the Average Reward Reinforcement Learning [repo](https://gitlab.inria.fr/omaillar/average-reward-reinforcement-learning) from Odalric Maillard. It mainly makes use of the learners and environments in order to implement the part relevant to the project more quickly. I could not get the experiment part to work properly so I added a wrapper for the learner to make them work with rlberry. The code relevant to the project is in the top level folder. This is mostly for me to experiment a bit at this early stage so the code is not well documented. I will improve it as I go along.

## Resource folder
